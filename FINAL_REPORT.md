# 📊 Michelin Supply Chain Analytics Dashboard – MSE 515 Project

An interactive dashboard and data analysis based on the Michelin global supply chain. This project combines academic principles from **MSE 515: Engineering Supply Chain Systems and Analytics** with advanced data visualization techniques using Power BI.

> 🔄 **Originally completed in December 2022** as a course final project at California State University, Northridge.  
> 🛠️ **Updated in January 2025** with simulated data for 2023–2024 to showcase real-world dashboard development, data modeling, and supply chain storytelling for portfolio purposes.

## 📌 Project Summary

This project analyzes Michelin’s global tire supply chain by:

- Mapping out the product structure and bill of materials
- Identifying core supply chain drivers
- Estimating landed costs and modeling logistics strategies
- Applying RCCA (Root Cause Corrective Action) and mitigation planning
- Measuring performance via KPIs such as delivery % and CO₂ emissions

---

## 🔧 Key Supply Chain Drivers

As originally documented, the six key drivers assessed are::

- 🏭 **Facilities** – Specialized manufacturing plants
- 📦 **Inventory** – Long shelf-life tire inventory strategy
- 🚚 **Transportation** – Mix of ground/ocean transport + 3PL
- 🧠 **Information** – Demand Driven Institute (DDI) systems
- 🔗 **Sourcing** – 200+ ingredients with strict auditing
- 💰 **Pricing** – Based on product category, geography, and quality

## ❓ What is NPS?

**NPS (Net Promoter Score)** is a widely used customer satisfaction metric that gauges how likely customers are to recommend a product or service to others.  
It is calculated based on responses to the question:  
_“How likely are you to recommend Michelin tires to a friend or colleague?”_

- Respondents rate on a scale of **0 to 10**
- Scores are classified as:
  - **Promoters (9–10)** – loyal enthusiasts
  - **Passives (7–8)** – satisfied but unenthusiastic
  - **Detractors (0–6)** – unhappy customers
- **NPS = % of Promoters – % of Detractors**

Michelin uses NPS to guide continuous improvement and customer experience strategy.
